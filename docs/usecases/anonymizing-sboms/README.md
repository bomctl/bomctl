# Anonymizing SBOMs

## Description

Usecase proposed by @mlieberman85 to "anonymize" an sbom (difference from redact) where a bendor is op with putting an SBOM in a platform like GUAC but something goes wrong, and the vendor wants to send a SBOM with sensitive data anonymized but not scrubbed.

So values like `John Smith <john.smith@acme.com>` becomes `Foo Bar <foo.bar@baz.com>`.
