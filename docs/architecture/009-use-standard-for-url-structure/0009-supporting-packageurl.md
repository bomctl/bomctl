# Investigation of using PackageURL as Command 'url'/location standard

## Description

Package URL Specification (purl spec): A minimal specification for purl aka. a package "mostly universal" URL.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)

A purl is a URL composed of seven components:

`scheme:type/namespace/name@version?qualifiers#subpath`

Components are separated by a specific character for unambiguous parsing.

The definition for each components is:

`scheme`: this is the URL scheme with the constant value of "pkg". One of the primary reason for this single scheme is to facilitate the future official registration of the "pkg" scheme for package URLs. Required.
`type`: the package "type" or package "protocol" such as maven, npm, nuget, gem, pypi, etc. Required.
`namespace`: some name prefix such as a Maven groupid, a Docker image owner, a GitHub user or organization. Optional and type-specific.
`name`: the name of the package. Required.
`version`: the version of the package. Optional.
`qualifiers`: extra qualifying data for a package such as an OS, architecture, a distro, etc. Optional and type-specific.
`subpath`: extra subpath within a package, relative to the package root. Optional.

Examples:

```bash
pkg:bitbucket/birkenfeld/pygments-main@244fd47e07d1014f0aed9c

pkg:deb/debian/curl@7.50.3-1?arch=i386&distro=jessie

pkg:docker/customer/dockerimage@sha256:244fd47e07d1004f0aed9c?repository_url=gcr.io

pkg:gem/jruby-launcher@1.1.2?platform=java

pkg:github/package-url/purl-spec@244fd47e07d1004f0aed9c

pkg:golang/google.golang.org/genproto#googleapis/api/annotations

pkg:maven/org.apache.xmlgraphics/batik-anim@1.9.1?packaging=sources
pkg:maven/org.apache.xmlgraphics/batik-anim@1.9.1?repository_url=repo.spring.io%2Frelease

pkg:npm/%40angular/animation@12.3.1
pkg:npm/foobar@12.3.1

pkg:pypi/django@1.11.1

pkg:rpm/fedora/curl@7.50.3-1.fc25?arch=i386&distro=fedora-25
pkg:rpm/opensuse/curl@7.56.1-1.1.?arch=i386&distro=opensuse-tumbleweed
```

## Advantages

- Similar to the format in use currently in bomctl
  - Many of the fields bomctl is looking for exist within a purl
- Purls are used in sboms, making it a logical jump to use in bomctl
- Users may be familiar with the standard since it's used in sboms
- Some built in support for various clients (git, oci, github)
  - This would aid in determining which client should be used
- This would simplify commands for operations on boms:
  - Linking would require pointing to a component within an sbom, which would use purl spec

## Disadvantages

- Bare urls would need to be wrapped in a useless formatting, or go through additional processing to turn into a purl
  - `pkg:generic/bomctl@0.4.1?download_url=https://github.com/bomctl/bomctl/releases/download/v0.4.1/bomctl_0.4.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz.spdx.json`
  - Or bare urls just get parsed and passed to http client. (make it a special case for usability)
- Does not support all prospective future clients (gitlab, dependency track, etc.)
  - Although gitlab is listed as a candidate for a potential future purl type
- Has support for many purl types we may never want to use (not necessarily a bad thing)
- Not sure this alleviates the problem of location strings in commands becoming and long and unwieldy with the use of qualifiers.
- Potentially requires users to know which client they'd want to use, which it'd be better to avoid
- Cannot express local files in this schema, may have to be handled as a generic string (as it is now)

## Practicality/Usability

- Soft enforcement of `pkg` prefix
  - We could allow users to leave off the `pkg:` prefix from their cmd and handle it if it's not there.
- Component Mapping:
  - Most purl component parts map directly to information we are currently collecting
  - Namespace could handle nested groups (gitlab style: instance/group/group/.../repo) or github style (just org/repo)
  - Any information missing, could be stored as qualifiers, like in the below examples
- Qualifiers
  - Since purls do not directly handle many components that may be seen in bomctl, like username, port, scheme, etc.
    It's necessary to use qualifiers to add this information, which could make the cmd string very long.
  - If we're wanting authentication to go through .netrc, would we need to support cmds that have the username/password info in them?
    - Supporting username and password in commands does help simplify running in CICD environments (with proper precautions setup)
    - Maybe separate flags for this?

## Examples

- HTTP Client
  - `pkg:generic/acme?download_url=example.acme.com`
  - `pkg:generic/bomctl@0.4.1?download_url=https://github.com/bomctl/bomctl/releases/download/v0.4.1/bomctl_0.4.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz.spdx.json`
    - If we would want the future github client to take this: `pkg:github/bomctl/bomctl@0.4.1#bomctl_0.4.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz.spdx.json`
- Git  (Although all these examples could also have the prefix `pkg:github` and use the future github client)
  - `pkg:git/bomct/bomctl@main?user=git#sbom.cdx.json`
  - `pkg:git/bomct/bomctl@main?user=git&port=12345&scheme=ssh#sbom.cdx.json`
  - `pkg:git/bomct/bomctl@main?user=git&password=password&port=12345#sbom.cdx.json`
  - `pkg:git/bomct/bomctl@main?user=git#sbom.cdx.json`
  - `pkg:git/bomct/bomctl@main?user=git#path/to/sbom.cdx.json`
- OCI Client
  - `pkg:oci/example/image@1.2.3?repository_url=registry.acme.com&username=username&port=12345`
  - `pkg:oci/example/image@1.2.3?repository_url=registry.acme.com`
