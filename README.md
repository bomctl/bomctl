__bomctl__ is format-agnostic Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) tooling, which is intended to bridge the gap between SBOM generation and SBOM analysis tools. It focuses on supporting more complex SBOM operations by being opinionated on only supporting the [NTIA minimum fields](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf) or other fields supported by [protobom](https://github.com/protobom/protobom).

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experimental project under active development. We'd love feedback on the concept, scope, and architecture!

## Features

- Work with multiple SBOMs in tree structures (through external references)
- Fetch and push SBOMs using HTTPS, OCI, and GIT protocols
- Leverage a `.netrc` file to handle authentication
- Manipulate SBOMs with commands like `diff`, `split`, and `redact`
- Manage SBOMs using a persistent database cache
- Interface with OpenSSF projects and services like [GUAC](https://guac.sh/) and [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)

## Installation

### Homebrew

```shell
brew tap bomctl/bomctl && brew install bomctl
```

### Container Images

Container images for bomctl can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bomctl/bomctl).

``` shell
docker run bomctl/bomctl:latest --help
```

### Install From Source

Installing bomctl requires the following:

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)

Clone the bomctl repository

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/bomctl/bomctl.git
cd bomctl
```

Build using the `Makefile`

| Operating System | Architecture | `make` Command           |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Linux            | AMD64        | `make build-linux-amd`   |
| Linux            | ARM          | `make build-linux-arm`   |
| Windows          | AMD64        | `make build-windows-amd` |
| Windows          | ARM          | `make build-windows-arm` |
| MacOS            | AMD64        | `make build-macos-intel` |
| MacOS            | ARM          | `make build-macos-apple` |

## Commands

### Fetch (Implemented)

Ability to retrieve an SBOM via several protocols:

- HTTP/S
- Git

and from various locations:

- Local Filesystem
- OCI

This includes recursive loading of external references in an SBOM to other SBOMs and placing them into the persistent cache. If SBOMs are access controlled, a user's [.netrc](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/manual/html_node/The-_002enetrc-file.html) file to authenticate.

### Diff (Planned)

### Lint (Planned)

TBD

### List (Planned)

### Merge (Planned)

TBD

### Push (Planned)

TBD

### Redact (Planned)

TBD

### Split (Planned)

TBD

### Trim (Planned)

Aliases:
  list, ls

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for list
```

### Merge

Merge specified cached SBOM documents.

```shell
  bomctl merge [flags] DOCUMENT_ID...

Flags:
  -h, --help          help for merge
  -n, --name string   Name of merged document
```

## Roadmap

The project is focused on building an architecture that enables reading in, operating on, and reading
out collections of SBOM files independent of format. This project requires an architecture that prioritizes the relationships between components in a SBOM document and between SBOM documents.

Once this architecture is established, more complex operations can be implemented. This operations include:

- `Diff`
  - Generating diffs between components and component dependencies
  - Generating diffs of component properties
  - Creating diffs in machine readable and human readable formats
- `Enrich`
  - Use the [Transparency Exchange API](https://github.com/CycloneDX/transparency-exchange-api) to find enrich sbom components with additional data.
  - Interface with [GUAC](https://guac.sh/)
- `Merge`
  - Merge fields from similar components in two or more SBOM documents
  - Merge components and component dependencies from two or more SBOM documents
  - Flatten multiple SBOM document component dependencies into a single SBOM document
- `Redact`
  - Redact fields by regular expressions or field name while keeping tracibility to the original document
- `Split`
  - Split an SBOM dependency tree into multiple files based on purl type or component identifier
- `Trim`
  - Trim an SBOM dependency tree based on purl type or component identifier
- __Your suggestions too!__

We use [Architecture Decision Records](docs/architecture/README.md) to track key decisions on the architecture and implementation details of `bomctl`. Decisions that are proposed but not finalized have the [adr label](https://github.com/bomctl/bomctl/labels/adr).

## Similar Projects

- [Kubernetes bom](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/bom) is a utility that lets you create, view and transform Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs). bom was created as part of the project to create an SBOM for the Kubernetes project. It enables software authors to generate an SBOM for their projects in a simple, yet powerful way.
- [CycloneDX sbom-utility](https://github.com/CycloneDX/sbom-utility) was designed to be an API platform to validate, analyze and edit Bills-of-Materials (BOMs). Initially, it was created to validate either CycloneDX or SPDX-formatted BOMs against official, versioned JSON schemas as published by their respective standards communities.
- [Hoppr](https://hoppr.dev/) is a Python plugin-based framework for collecting, processing, and bundling your software supply chain.
- [sbommerge](https://github.com/anthonyharrison/sbommerge) merges two Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) documents together. It supports SBOMs created in both SPDX and CycloneDX formats.

## Verifying Integrity

### Verifying Container Images

Container images for `bomctl` can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/bomctl/bomctl) and are signed
using keyless signing with cosign.

You can then verify this container image with cosign.

``` shell
cosign verify --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github\.com/bomctl/bomctl/\.github/.+'  bomctl/bomctl:latest
```

### Verifying Releases

`bomctl` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/bomctl/bomctl/releases) and are signed
using keyless signing with cosign.

You can then verify this artifact with cosign.

``` shell
cosign verify-blob --certificate ${artifact}-keyless.pem --signature ${artifact}-keyless.sig --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github\.com/bomctl/bomctl/\.github/.+'  ${artifact}
```

If the result is `Verified OK`, the verification is successful.

You can also look up the entry in the public Rekor instance using a sha256 hash.

``` shell
shasum -a 256 bomctl_SNAPSHOT-3f16bdb_checksums.txt |awk '{print $1}'
```

The printed `hash` can be used to look up the entry at <https://search.sigstore.dev/>.
